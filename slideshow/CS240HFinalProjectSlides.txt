# What is a Suffix Array?

- An encoding of a suffix tree.
- But actually an array that contains the indices of every substring of a given string or strings.
- It can be generated in O(n) time and can be used to find out properties of the strings, like Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and some other shit.
- Other stuff. Cool stuff.
